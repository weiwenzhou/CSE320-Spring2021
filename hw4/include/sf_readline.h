 * The following function prints a prompt on stdout and collects an arbitrarily
 * long line from stdin, similarly to GNU readline.  The string that is returned does
 * not contain the line terminator '\n', so that inputting a blank line returns the
 * empty string.  An EOF condition on stdin is treated as if it were a newline,
 * except in case the input line is empty, in which case NULL is returned.
 * The string that is returned is allocated with malloc, and it is the client's
 * responsibility to free it.
 *
 * @param prompt  The prompt to be shown to the user.
 * @return a string containing the input line typed by the user, not including any
 * line termination character.  The caller must free this string when finished
 * with it.
