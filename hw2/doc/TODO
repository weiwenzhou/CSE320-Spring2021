Things to do:
URGENT
 - fix chess/gnuan output for promotion
 - rebuild latex output to fit better with Piet Tutelaers macros.

LATER
 - command line specification of chess symbols for a new language
 - to have configuration file
 - automatically add sufixes (.tex, ps, .asc, .roff .xboard.save ...) to
output file
 - add a xbord save-position format
 - detect check
 - a binary save format, allowing another program to interactively
replay the game (this should lead to a kind of "ChessBase" program ).
