** DESCRIPTION
  This program is is chess preprocessor. It reads chess games, either
in full algebraic or shortened notation (ie Nf1-g3 or f1g3 or Ng3) and
is able to output the games and/or the board af any move, in ascii,
postscript, TeX, or nroff. It also can generate output for the gnuan
and xboard programs. It is multi-lingual (european) for piece
identification. The program understand french, english, german,
spanish dutch, italian, polish etc. The program also handle variations
and symbolized comments.

This is a freeware program. You have the right to modify it, give it,
provided you don't modify the copyright notice and my name still
remains.  The distribution has 4 shar-type files.

** COMPATIBILITY
  This program is ok on UNIX (Sun Sparc Station and Sun-3). It uses
standard C, and fonctions declarations are done in both K&R-C and
ANSI-C.  It won't difficult to compile on a IBM-PC with
MSC (I easily get to work an older function with TURBO-C).

** QUICK USE
  Anyway, you want to try quickly the program, issue the command
"make" in this directory, and then type "notation algebric.txt" to
test the programm on Kasparov/Karpov game 13 (Lyon, November 1990).
If you want to install it completely ( TeX, helpfile etc), edit the
Makefile and type "make install".  Read and modify the makefile for
customizing notation to your national language and library path.  If
you want a complete manual, read notation.doc.  To print a postscript
file, merge the ps font definition and the output of the Notation
program (say foo.ps) and send it to the printer (for instance "cat
Cheq foo.ps | lpr").

** SOURCES
  NOTA: <version number> is currently 3.9

  They are posted to "comp.sources.misc". You can then get them from
any site archiving "comp.sources.misc".

  They are available by anonymous ftp on wuarchive.wustl.edu,
(user:anonymous, password:<your address>). The path is
"pub/Notation.tar.Z" ou "pub/Notation<version number>.tar.Z"
The patch are also available as "Notation-patch<version number>.shar.Z".

 ** I expect the source to show up soon on garbo.uwasa.fi.
If you're in Europe, you can get notation from the server
garbo.uwasa.fi:
-- by anonymous ftp with path /unix/util/notation.tar.Z
-- by e-mail by sending the message

        mail mailserv@garbo.uwasa.fi
        Subject:garbo-request
        send unix/util/notation.tar.Z

        (or  send unix/util/notation<version number>.tar.Z)

   You will receive the uuencoded-split program within hours.

  You can also get them by mail, from "hthomas@ph.tn.tudelft.nl". But
I prefer you try the others before.


** IMPORTANT
  If you want to use PostScript or LaTeX, you need two packages not
provided here. However, here is a way to get them:

**** Postscript: 
  You need the font "Cheq", freely distributed by Adobe.  Send a mail
to "ps-file-server@adobe.com" with the body "send Programs
chessfont.ps". For use with "notation", rename the file "Cheq".

------------------------------------------------------------------
chessfont.ps              58548 Jun 22 1989
    This is the Adobe chess font "Cheq", created by John Renner. It 
    is an ASCII downloadable version of the font that is not in any 
    particular font format for a specific platform. See also
    "chessfontUNIX.shar" and "chessfontMAC.shar" for the font bundled 
    with other useful files like screen fonts and AFM files. If you 
    just want the font, it is available in this file separately for 
    convenience.
------------------------------------------------------------------

**** LaTeX: 
  You need the chess fonts designed by Piet Tutalaers
"rcpt@urc.tue.nl". YOU NEED VERSION 1.2 (released 10/02/91). The
complete distribution is available

-- by ftp : on sol.cs.ruu.nl (131.211.80.5) with path TEX/chess.tar.Z
(please restrict access to weekends or evening/night (i.e.  between
about 2000 and 0.900 UTC)).

end

The path command can be deleted if we receive a valid from address in
your message. If this is the first time you use the mail server, we
suggest you first issue the request:
send help

** USER FEEDBACK

  If you're happy with this program, let me know :-) Thanks.


** MODIFICATIONS

  I hope the program to be clear enough to be easily modified. Anyway,
I would like to centralize modification, in order to manage an
up-to-date version. So send me the modification, in forms of diff
files, if possible, along with the version number of the program.
