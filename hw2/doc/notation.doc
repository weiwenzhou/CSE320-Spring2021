NAME
     notation - transform chess notation


SYNOPSYS
     notation [input file] [-o output file] [-options...]


DESCRIPTION
     This program reads chess games,  either  full  algebraic  or
     shortened (ie Nf1-g3 or Ng3) and is able to ouptut the board
     after any move, in either ascii , postscript, nroff,  latex,
     xboard  or  gnuan  save  format. This program is also multi-
     lingual:  it  handles  english,  french,  spanish,   german,
     italian, dutch, romanian etc... symbols. So nearly all euro-
     peans languages are understood (except  greek  and  russian,
     but  I  can't  handle  greek or cyrillic on ascii computers,
     eh).


OPTIONS
     Command line options:


     -a
             algebraic move notation output


     -s
             shortened move notation output


     -f <language>
             specifies  the  chess  symbol  input  language.  The
             language  can  be  any  of french, english, italian,
             spanish, german, dutch,  czech,  hungarian,  polish,
             romanian, FIDE.


     -t <language>
             specifies the chess  symbol  output  language.  Same
             options as input language.


     <inputfile>
             specifies the  input  file.  If  none,  keyboard  is
             assumed.


     -o <outputfile>
             specifies  the  output  file.  If  none,  screen  is
             assumed.

     -c <number>[,<number]
             specifies the number  of  the  moves  at  which   to
             display  the  board.  If none, board is displayed at
             end of file. Several numbers may be specified, as  a
             comma-separated list.


     -e <number>
             display the board at the move number and then stops


     -b
             display only the board, not the moves


     -d <drivername>
             specifies the output driver. It can be  any  of  the
             following:  ascii,  postscript,  tex,  roff,  xchess
             (xchess or xboard save  format),  gnu  (gnuan  input
             format).


     -i
             suppress headers/footers printing.  This  is  useful
             with  tex  or ps drivers, if you want to include the
             output in a larger file.


     -v
             displays version number and exits


     -h
             displays help screen


INPUT LANGUAGE
           The input language has four  types  of  input:  moves,
     move numbers, comments and keywords. All these are separated
     by blanks, TAB, CR, commas and semi-columns.


     move format:
              The moves are accepted in  algebraic  or  shortened
             algebraic  notation.   That means that the following
             are equivalent and accepted  Nf1-g3  N-f1xg3,  Nxg3,
             Ng3,  Nfg3.  The  ugly  english notation P-K4 is not
             understood, neither by the program nor me.  The pro-
             gram allows and parse variations.

             Nota: provided you  remove  the  three  first  line,
             xchess save format is accepted.

              Also you can have move comments.  So  Kg4!!,  Ra5++
             are  correct, as Kg4 !!, Ra5 ++.  Castling is recog-
             nized with the following 0-0 O-O o-o 0-0-0 O-O-O  o-
             o-o.   "En  passant" and promotion are now correctly
             handled. For "en passant", you  just  indicate  them
             move  and  it is correctly parsed ex: "d5-d7 e5xd6".
             Promotion is indicated with the "=" sign followed by
             the  new  piece name. So you just write "a7-a8=Q" or
             "d8=K". If you omit the  piece  name,  promotion  is
             made  to Queen by default; so "a8=" is equivalent to
             "a8=Q".

             For   example,   see   the   files    algebraic.txt,
             shortened.txt and boudy.txt


     move numbers:
              move numbers are in the form 23. or  36.  The  full
             point  is optional. Move numbers are checked against
             internal move counter.


     comments:
               chess codified comments can be put in  the  input.
             There  are two ways or doing so. The first one is to
             use the usual chess notation !?, !, ,+, ++,  #,  ep,
             etc  ...  However,  international magazine use other
             no-ascii symbols : triangles, squares, infinity  and
             so  on. You can have these symbols  on LaTeX output.
             This is the second  way.  I  defined  three  letters
             abbreviations  for  such  symbols  (look at the file
             chesssymb.txt for an extensive  description).  These
             abbreviations  are  following a $ sign. For instance
             $wsb means "white slightly better".  This is,  IMHO,
             a very interesting feature of the program.


     text:    plain text, such as  explanations  etc...  must  be
             enclosed  in  brackets  or  parenthesis [Here Karpov
             made a very bright move ...] (this is  also  a  com-
             ment).   Comments   are  not  parsed,  but  directly
             inserted in the output, for  the  ascii  ,nroff  and
             latex drivers. The closing characters (ie "]" or ")"
             depending of the opening characters may be placed in
             the  text,  provided it is escaped by a "\" ( so you
             input "\]" or "\)" ).


     variations:
              You can have variations in  the  source.  Variation
             are  in  enclosing  {  }  . You can have up to three
             level of variation. It would  be  enough  for  human

             players.  A  variation always follows the move. Here
             is an exemple of variation : 25. Rb2 {  Ce4  de4  26
             Fc3 Fa3! 27. Ff6 Tb3 } Fa3!


     keywords:
              You can insert keywords in the input text  to  pre-
             cisely  define  what you want: displaying the board,
             configuring it... Keywords are detailled in the next
             section.


KEYWORDS
     all keywords are prefixed with @

     @startplay
              begins the play. Obligatory after a @configxxx key-
             word.

     @clearboard
             clears the board. Used prior to any @configxxx.

     @showboard
             displays the board. Can be used anywhere

     @whitesmove
             tells the program that is the white's turn of  play.
             Useful after a @configxxx and @startplay

     @blacksmove
             tells the program that it is black's turn

     @configwhite
             initializes configuration of white side. Pieces  are
             then  expected, in form of (optional for Pawn) name,
             the position. Example @configwhite Ke3 Rg8 e4.

     @configblack
             initializes configuration of black side. Pieces  are
             then  expected, in form of (optional for Pawn) name,
             the position. Example: @configblack Ka8 Nf6 e6.

             Note that black pieces are given in uppercase!


     @default
             resets the board to the default start configuration.

             @special all following text up to the  next  cariage
             return is not processed, but instead directly print.
             This allows to insert comments in  ascii  files,  or
             tex commands when tex output is selected.

     @null   null keyword. Does nothing. Used for convenience  in
             programming.


             See the file keywords.txt for an example of keywords
             use.

DRIVERS
     ascii    this is the default driver,  it  outputs  move  and
             boards.


     postscript
               It generates a  file  using  the  font  file  Cheq
             licensed  for  free  by  Adobe.  It  is only able to
             display one board per run. Move are  not  displayed.
             You  need  the  font  "Cheq",  freely distributed by
             Adobe.  Send a  mail  to  "ps-file-server@adobe.com"
             with the body "send Programs chessfont.ps".


     tex       This is a latex  driver.  It  uses  the  TeX/LaTeX
             chess    macros    designed    by   Piet   Tutalaers
             "rcpt@urc.tue.nl".  The  complete  distribution   is
             available  on sol.cs.ruu.nl (131.211.80.5) with path
             TEX/chess.tar.Z. Refer to your local latex  guru  to
             install it.


     roff      This is a driver for nroff output.  It  is  crude,
             but it works. Moves and boards are displayed.

     xchess    This  driver  generates  compatible  xchess/xboard
             save  files, thus allowing you to replay a game with
             xchess.


     gnu       This driver generates "bare" output, with only the
             algebraic  move.   It  is suitable for any low-level
             analyser, such as gnuan.


EXAMPLES
          Try the following commands:

     notation algebraic.txt
             this will read the  Karpov-Kasparov  game  13  (Lyon
             1990)  in  algebraic form, display move in shortened
             algebraic and display board at end of game.

     notation algebraic.txt -s
             this will do the same thing, as -a stands for  alge-
             braic output.

     notation algebraic.txt -a
             the game will now be output in full-length algebraic

     notation shortened.txt
             there is no problem to read shortened algebraic.

     notation shortened -s -o result
             the moves and board will be directed to file result

     notation shortened.txt -s -t french
             output will use french notation

     notation a_dutch_file -f dutch -t spanish
             game will be translated form dutch to spanish

     notation shortened -c 2
             board after move 2 will  be  displayed,  along  with
             moves and end-of-game board

     notation shortened.txt -e 2
             board after move 2 will  be  displayed,  along  with
             moves. The program will then stops

     notation shortened.txt -c 2,5,20
             board after moves 2, 5 and  20  will  be  displayed,
             along with moves and end-of-game board

     notation shortened.txt -c 2,5,20 -b
             board after moves 2, 5 and  20  will  be  displayed,
             with end-of-game board, but no moves.

notation(n)       MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES        notation(n)



     notation shortened.txt -c 2,5,20 -d tex
             the output will be formatted to use with latex.  You
             can directly latex the output file.

     notation shortened.txt -c 2,5,20 -d gnu
             you can now replay  the  game  by  using  xchess  -r
             out.gnu.

     notation shortened.txt -e 5 -d postscript
             Now issue cat lib/Cheq out.ps | lpr to display on  a
             Laser  Printer  the  board  at  move 5. You can also
             issue sh print-ps out-ps.  The postcript driver does
             not support the -c option.

     notation boudy.txt -d tex -o boudy.tex
             This is the all-star, all-singing  demonstration  of
             the  notation  program.  Runs latex on boudy.tex and
             print result.


FILES
     algebraic.txt shortened.txt keywords.txt boudy.txt

     chesssymb.tex
              this is the LaTeX file containing  the  definitions
             of  the codified comment. You can include it in your
             own LaTeX files: you will be able to use  the  chess
             comments. The file is stand-alone. To iclude comment
             in LaTeX, just type  \COM<three  letter  name>.  For
             instance  \COMwsb  inserts  the  symbol  for "whites
             stands lightly better".

DIAGNOSTICS
     Errors messages are hoped to be self-explanative.


COMMENTS
     The program is quite large, due  to  the  extensive  use  of
     tables  and variables to control its features. The advantage
     is you only need the modify these tables  to  customize  it:
     for instance adding a new language or tuning the output for-
     mat to your own needs.


BUGS
     Too many. Report them to Henry.Thomas@irisa.fr.

     The postscript driver *might* fail if you try to display the
     board  two times. Anyway, it is not designed to do this. Use
     -e option to specify the move at which you want  to  display
     board.

     Do not enter  two  levels  of  variation  without  any  move
     between  them.  It  will cause the crash of the program. For
     instance, { { is wrong, but  { Qd1 { is correct.
